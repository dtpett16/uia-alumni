New pages and page updates will include ideas and suggestions based on comments submitted on this page.<br><br>We are currently working to complete pages for all of the "Under Construction" links and menu options. Next we'll go to work on the site's main home page. Eventually it will replace the one you see when you click "Home".<br><br>Check out the column to the right to see areas where your input is especially important. Feel free to include other ideas, suggestions and constructive criticism. Thanks for your input.

It will be different from the current home page.<br><br>Differences will include content specifically directed toward Adventurers.

What filter options would you like to see, if any?<br><br>When a destination is selected, a new page will open. It will be the main page for that destination. Creating an example is high on our priority list. As a retired traveller, what would you like to see on a destination's main page?</p>
