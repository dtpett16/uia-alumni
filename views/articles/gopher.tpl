		<p class="content">The Go gopher is an iconic mascot and one of the most distinctive features of the <em>Go</em> project. This article talks about his origins, evolution, and behavior. About 15 years ago—long before the Go project—the gopher first appeared as a promotion for the <a href="https://wfmu.org/">WFMU radio station</a> in New Jersey. <a href="http://reneefrench.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Renee French</a> was commissioned to design a T-shirt for an annual fundraiser and out came the gopher.

		<p class="content">He next made an appearance at Bell Labs, as Bob Flandrena's <a href="http://research.swtch.com/face" target="_blank">avatar</a> in the Bell Labs mail system. Other Renee drawings became avatars for ken, r, rsc, and others later involved in the <em>Go</em> project. (Of course, Peter Weinberger's was his own <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html" target="_blank">iconic face</a>). Another Bell Labs activity led to Renee creating Glenda, the Plan 9 mascot, a distant cousin of the WFMU gopher.</p><br>
